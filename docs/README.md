# The Liquid Messages Plugin

# Introduction
The Liquid Messages (lqdm) WordPress Plugin is a free and open source messages/sermon archive for use by churches. It provides a robust means to maintain series and individual messages along with their associated meta data (videos, images, audio files, descriptions, etc.) in a publicly accessible form.

# Origin Story
Justin Sternberg (@jsternberg) created the core GC-Sermons WordPress plugin. Liquid Church then contracted Justin to significantly expand the plugin. Since then Liquid Church has contracted Suraj Gupta to continue to expand and refine the plugin. Development of the plugin has occurred under the direction of Dave Mackey (@davidshq).

For more information on the differences between GC-Sermons and Liquid Messages see [GCLQDMComparison.md](GCLQDMCompoarsion.md).
