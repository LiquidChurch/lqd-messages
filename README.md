# Fork of GC-Sermons
Justin Sternberg (@jsternberg) created the core GC-Sermons WordPress plugin. Liquid Church then contracted Justin to significantly expand the plugin. Since then Liquid Church has contracted Suraj Gupta to continue to expand and refine the plugin. Development of the plugin has occurred under the direction of Dave Mackey (@davidshq).
