== Description ==

WDS-Shortcodes gives developers the ability to easily register shortcodes with a corresponding button, so never again will your client ask, `What's that shortcode again?` Not only can you easily handle the button and shortcode registration, this also supports self-closing and wrapping shortcodes with a simple config flag.

Additionally, there is also built-in [CMB2](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/) support so you can use all your favorite fields.

For more info, [check out the wiki](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Shortcodes/wiki).
